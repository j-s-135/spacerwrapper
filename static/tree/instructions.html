<ul><li>Please report issues to support.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><b><i>TOOLBAR</i></b>
<ul><li>The toolbar above is just for manipulating the tree, not for editing text. A separate menu pops up when you edit a line, as described below.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><b><i>EDITING ONE LINE AT A TIME</i></b>
<ul><li>Select a line, press the 'edit' button, and select an option.</li><li>Data tree lingo: this line is called a 'parent' of the lines within it.

<ul><li>This line is called a 'child' of the parent line.</li><li>This line is called a 'sibling' of the previous line.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Select multiple lines by dragging vertically.</li>
<li>By default, copying or moving right only applies to the visibly selected lines, without their children, unless you choose 'copy with children' or 'section right'.</li>
<li>Moving left always applies to an entire section, including its children.
</li>
<li>The 'undo' option only undoes the single most recent command.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><b><i>CLEARING THE TEXT</i></b>
<ul><li>To prevent loss of data, the command window has been removed. Previously, typing NEW into the command window cleared the text.</li>
<li>Instead, clear the text by explicitly removing it.</li>
<li>Select multiple lines by dragging, select 'edit', then select 'remove' or 'cut'.</li>
<li>Do not remove all of the lines. You cannot select the root of the tree for editing purposes. Instead, leave a line at the top, then overwrite it.</li>
<li>If you remove all of the lines, you cannot insert a new line. Select 'undo', or refresh the page and start over.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><b><i>EQUATIONS</i></b>
<ul><li>To insert an equation, select 'eqn' from the popup editor. In the equation editor, after finishing your equation, select 'copy to document'. Then, click 'submit eqn'. Finally, select the button on the left which says 'overwrite', 'sibling', or 'child'.</li>
<li>These equations are only visible with an internet connection.</li>
<li>Ignore the equation editor when it says 'invalid equation'. Continue until your equation is finished and then the equation should be visible.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><b><i>OTHER TOOLBAR BUTTONS</i></b>
<ul><li>The EXPAND and COLLAPSE buttons apply to the most recently highlighted line and its children. You may also select the root of the tree to refer to the entire tree.</li>
<li>The NUMBER button prints line numbers for each line. They are removable with RESET.</li>
<li>The REPLACE button replaces text based on the two textboxes to the left. Type the text you want to replace in the first box, and the replacement text in the second box. Press REPLACE to start, then REPLACE to replace the first highlighted word, or SKIP to skip it, then repeat until finished. It is case sensitive and finds exact matches only.</li>
<li>To ALPHABETIZE, first press NUMBER, find the appropriate start and stop line numbers, type them in, press RESET to remove the line numbers, then press ALPHABETIZE.</li>
<li>LOAD and SAVE are for copy/pasting. SAVE only saves an html file. Press SAVE, copy the text, paste it into an empty file, and save the file as .html. Copy the html, press LOAD, paste it in, and press HTML. Alternately, load an indented text file by pasting it in and pressing TEXT.</li>
</ul>
